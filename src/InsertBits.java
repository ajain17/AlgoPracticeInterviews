/**
 * Created by ayushij on 1/2/17.
 * You are given two 32-bit numbers, Nand M, and two bit positions, la n d j . Write
 a method to insert M into Nsuch that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i.
 You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit allof M.
 That is, if M= 10011, you canassumethat there areat least 5 bits between j and i.
 You would not,forexample, have j = 3 and i = 2,because M could notfully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 EXAMPLE
 Input: N=10000000000,M=10011,i=2,j=6 Output:N = 10001001100
